# Mobile Number MCC and MCN retrieval service
### CURRENT PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT NOT FOR USE
I saw one question on Quora that how can we retrieve MCC and MCN from mobile
number I am being Voip Engineer, felt a realy need for this. But I found it is
very difficult to get these numbers. As there is no such data which can match
E164 number to MCN and MCC.

This is collection of some csv file I created for this purpose, and I will
launch a new API service where you can provde any mobile/landline number and it
will give you details about its network and landline featuers with countrya nd
areas.

This is just startup project for this. Follow steps to make your own API in ruby
on rails.
